## GasCast speak exclusively with Bristol Rovers centre back Alfie Kilgour, following his rise from the youth team.

<!--more-->

As a football supporter, you love to see a local lad rise through the youth academy and burst onto the first team scene. 

That's just what self-confessed Gashead Alfie Kilgour has done this season, impressing fans with his combative performances at the heart of the Bristol Rovers back line.

Harley had the pleasure of speaking with Alfie one-on-one in an exclusive interview, as they discuss his journey from the youth team to the first team.

They look back at the lows: the horrendous injury he suffered when on the brink of breaking into the first team. And the highs: that memorable performance at Plymouth away on his debut. 

From concerns about whether he was good enough when he first became a scholar, to dreaming of one day taking the captaincy, learn all about the makings of Alfie Kilgour.
