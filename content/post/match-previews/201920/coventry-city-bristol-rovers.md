### Bristol Rovers head to Coventry City this weekend hoping to get their first three points of the season.

It may seem funny to think but this will treated as an away trip for both teams, with Coventry still accustoming to their new surroundings at St Andrews (Birmingham City’s ground).

The Sky Blues are spending the 2019/20 season at St Andrews due to them being unable to secure a deal to remain at the Ricoh Arena.

Both Rovers and Coventry were victorious in their midweek Carabao Cup First Round matches. Rovers overcame Cheltenham 3-0 whilst Coventry beat Exeter 4-1 with both League One sides handed Premier League teams in Round Two. 

Rovers will host Brighton with Coventry heading to Vicarage Road to face Watford and new signing Matt Godden, who scored in the win has spoken of how important a cup run could be to the Sky Blues.

“Promotion is obviously where we all want to be but a cup run is massive for the club and massive for our confidence,” [Godden told the Coventry telegraph] (https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/whos-going-turn-down-matt-16760864)

“We’ve got a big away tie where we can compete against the best players in the world; who’s going to turn that down.”

Coventry winger Gervane Kastaneer could make his first start for his new side after recovering from an ankle injury that kept him out of the first two league games but he will have to oust fellow new signing Wesley Jobello who has started all three competitive fixtures this term.

Rovers go into the game with fans optimistic from Tuesday night’s win, especially due to the performances of strikers Jonson Clarke-Harris and Tyler Smith.

Smith scored a brace and set up Clarke-Harris for Rovers’ third and manager Graham Coughlan has commented on the newly struck up partnership.

"Tyler was excellent,” [Coughlan told the Bristol Post] (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graham-coughlan-full-transcript-rovers-3210474) 

“We have been short of strikers. We didn’t have a pre-season with Tyler, Victor or Jonno for one reason or another we couldn’t work with them all and get them up to speed.

"The only fit striker we had over the course of pre-season was Tom Nichols and then obviously Gav Reilly moved on, so to get all three of them on the pitch and to get them some game time was great, I thought they looked very sharp but there is more to come from the three of them.

"They did okay, they have minutes under their belt, game time, a performance at the Mem, some goals.

"I thought it was a great pass by Tyler for Jonno’s goal as well, and I said it in the changing rooms I probably would have hit that myself.”

Coughlan has no fresh injury concerns ahead of the game but is facing a selection headache in attack and defence after strong performances from his strikers on Tuesday night and also academy graduate Alfie Kilgour.
