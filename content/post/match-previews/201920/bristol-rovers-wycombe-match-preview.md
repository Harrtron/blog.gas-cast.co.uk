Bristol Rovers host Wycombe Wanderers in their first home game of the new season.

The Gas go into the game having suffered an opening day defeat at the hands of Blackpool whilst Saturday’s opponents Wycombe ran out 2-0 winners over financially stricken Bolton Wanderers.

Both Rovers and Wycombe watched on as the Transfer Deadline Day for Premier League and Championship clubs ticked down without any of their players being snapped up, however fans will still have a worrying thought in the back of their mind as the League One Deadline is not until September 2nd.

With the League 1 Transfer deadline just over three weeks away, Rovers boss Graham Coughlan spoke of his need to get another striker in the building.

Rovers have let Gavin Reilly go out on loan and with Deon Moore only on a short term deal, Coughlan has four strikers at his disposal, two of which are loanees in the form of Tyler Smith and Victor Adeboyejo.

> “I am certainly looking [to add a striker] as well,” [Coughlan told the Bristol Post] (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/state-play-bristol-rovers-transfer-3188200).

 > “If the right one came up, we lost one yesterday who went away to Fleetwood, Ched Evans was somebody that we liked, but again out of our remit.

> “Unless I can get favours, unless people are willing to do me a turn we might have to move one or two out and make adjustments here, there and everywhere to try and get what we want.

> “It is a difficult process, it is not as easy as I had imagined all those years as a football fan, as a coach, as a player. I just thought you could go out and get what you wanted in the market but I am learning the realities of football.” 

Rovers will be without Tareiq Holmes-Dennis who remains out but Coughlan may be able to call on Jonson Clarke-Harris after the striker had another full week of training under his belt as he continues to recover from injury.

Wycombe go into the game after a strong opening day performance at home to Bolton.

The last meeting between Rovers and Wycombe at the Memorial Stadium ended in a 1-0 win for the away side and Chairboys manager Gareth Ainsworth is looking forward to another ‘spicy’ encounter.

> “It is a game where we always have a bit of spice because of what has gone on in recent years,” [Ainsworth told the Bucks Free Press] (https://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/sport/17824771.gareth-ainsworth-previews-sides-clash-bristol-rovers/)

> “It is a huge club. They will have 10,000 plus there for their first home game of the season.

> “They had a tough opener at Blackpool and they will be strong this season but Bristol is always a tough place to go.

> “We managed to get a win last year in what was a very scrappy, tight game but Graham Coughlan will be wanting his first win of the season and we don’t want our first defeat so I will be making sure we have done all our preparation right.

> “The added atmosphere can be intense and I will be making the boys aware of that.

> “Also we can almost use that to our advantage. If we have a good start it can get nervy there as well.”

The Chairboys have no new injury concerns going into the second game of the season meaning 37 year old Adebayo Akinfenwa may keep his place in the starting line up.
