Bristol Rovers head to Yorkshire to face Doncaster Rovers this weekend buoyed by their impressive run of form.

The Gas beat MK Dons 1-0 last time out to extend their unbeaten run in League One to six matches.

That unbeaten run has helped Rovers climb up to fourth in the table but manager Graham Coughlan has stated that wants more from his side.

“I have to be realistic, we have to be happy, we have to be pleased, I strive for perfection, perfection is first so I have to strive for the best I possibly can, but like I say it’s a far better place than it was 12 months ago,” [he told the Bristol Post] (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-transcript-graham-coughlan-3422830)

“There are a lot more smiles on the faces, there’s a lot more positivity, let’s enjoy it and let’s keep our feet on the ground.

“I’m pretty sure there will be one or two bumps on the road to the end of the season but once we can consolidate and not only improve our league position but the football club as a whole this season then that will be a decent outcome.

Rovers will welcome back goalkeeper Anssi Jaakkola to the side after international duty for Finland. They will however, be without striker Jonson Clarke-Harris who will be out for a month through injury, he joins Ollie Clarke, Mark Little, Josh Hare and Tareiq Holmes-Dennis on the treatment table. 

Doncaster go into the game having lost three of their last six league games after a strong start to the season.

Doncaster’s most recent defeat came at the fans of Oxford United last time out and manager Darren Moore did not hold back on criticising his side after the game.

“Credit to Oxford because they are a good team, but there were areas where we needed to be better. It was a tough day for us, but we’ve got to learn from this,” [he told the club’s website.] (https://www.doncasterroversfc.co.uk/news/2019/october/moore-well-learn-lessons-but-move-on-quickly/)

“I’m disappointed with the result, we needed to show more aggression to capitalise on the game, but we missed those opportunities. It was a bad day, but at times we had chances to get back into it.”
One plus point from the weekend for Doncaster though was that striker Niall Ennis returned from injury unscathed and will be in contention to start against Rovers this weekend.
