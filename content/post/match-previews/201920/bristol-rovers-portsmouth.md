# Bristol Rovers entertain Portsmouth this weekend looking to bounce back after two defeats that ended their six game unbeaten run in League One.

Rovers lost 2-0 to both Doncaster and bottom club Bolton this week meaning that they were the first side the latter defeated this season.

Goals from Luke Murphy and Daryl Murphy were enough to see off the Gas who were outthought and outplayed by the league’s bottom side.

Manager Graham Coughlan could not hide his disappointment following the match either, knowing that his side were left empty handed, but he did have some optimistic views on the season as a whole so far.

"I thought it was poor,” [Coughlan told the Bristol Post] (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/graham-coughlan-full-transcript-tom-3455858)

“I thought we didn’t turn up, I thought we got what we deserved and it wasn’t just the 90 minutes it was the 45 on Saturday as well.

"That’s a game and a half throughout the season, it’s been a positive season, the lads have dug deep, they’ve rolled their sleeves up, but tonight there were too many off of it, too many not at it, too many silly, basic errors.”

Rovers will hope to have Liam Sercombe back in contention and given the two defeats in a row, Coughlan may look to shake things up. Both Mark Little and Luke Leahy were unused subs on Tuesday night. With Coughlan’s 3-5-2 formation looking steady in the most part, he may opt to switch his wing backs around.

Portsmouth go into the game having had a difficult start to their League One campaign.

Pompey have won just once away this season and sit 16th in the League, scoring just four goals away from home in six games but under pressure boss Kenny Jackett has stated that the goals will come.

“There has been a lack of goals lately,” [Jackett told the club’s website] (https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2019/october/jackett-goals-will-come/)

“We’ve tightened up at one end but haven’t put enough away at the other.

“Whether you’re creating the chances is irrelevant – the bottom lines is how many you score. It’s a big thing.

“That might be about creating more openings, or it might be about being more clinical when they do come along.

“But I do have confidence in my players that it will come and we certainly have the quality there to do that.

“It’s up to us to make sure we break through because we have to do something about the lack of goals, without losing anything in defence.”

Pompey have no new injury concerns ahead of Saturday’s League One match at Bristol Rovers. This means both former Rovers players Lee Brown and Ellis Harrison are in contention to play against their old club.

Brett Pitman is closest to returning to fitness, although the Memorial Stadium contest will likely come too soon for the striker. The match will also come too soon for Oli Hawkins and Bryn Morris.
