Bristol Rovers entertain Tranmere Rovers on Tuesday night still looking for a first league win of the season.

Rovers now sit 21st in League One after three games with one draw and two defeats, the most recent being a 2-0 loss away at Coventry.

Goals from Jordan Shipley and Gervane Kastaneer were enough to see off the Gas who did not register a single shot on target.

Rovers however did manage to put the ball in the back of the net through a Tom Davies header, only for the defender’s effort to be ruled out for a foul. 

It has since come out though that the goal was wrongly disallowed, with Rovers manager Graham Coughlan receiving an apology from the referee’s association.

"The referees association has apologised to myself, and the football club over the weekend,” [Coughlan told the Bristol Post] (https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-coventry-referee-efl-3225664)

“Mike Jones has come and apologised for the goal they disallowed.

"At this moment in time the little details like that are not coming our way, the little rub of green, the little bits and pieces are not going our way.

"The only way you get through that is by putting in the hard work on the training ground, you roll your sleeves up, you dig deep, you work your way through and you earn your own luck."

Rovers will hope to have Mark Little and Alex Rodman back after the duo missed the defeat at St Andrews through injury. Another encouraging sign for Rovers is that Tareiq Holmes-Dennis appears to be back in training after missing pre-season through injury.

Tranmere head to the South-West in high spirit after thrashing a youthful Bolton 5-0 at the weekend.

Tranmere are back in the third tier after five years away which included them dropping out of the league. 

But now they are back in League One after a play off final win over Newport in May and club captain Scott Davies has insisted that they must continue to apply themselves on a consistent basis in order to perform at an higher level.

“Regardless of results, we know what we want and how to achieve it so you will hear the manager bang on about it a lot but we play with a plan and sticking to our principles,” [Davies told the club’s website] (https://www.tranmererovers.co.uk/news/2019/august/davies-on-bristol-rovers-challenge/)

“And if we go into most of the games this season and do that, we’ll stick to the principles and play with the plan, then we will come out with more positive results than negatives.

“That’s why we went to Wembley and we won and worked so hard to get here. We want these challenges, we want to put Tranmere back among these clubs.

“We’re not here to make the numbers up, we’re going there to win the game and if we stick to our principles, we’ve got every chance.”

Tranmere manager Micky Mellon has no new injury concerns and may even opt to name an unchanged side given their impressive result on Saturday. 

This would mean that striker Stefan Payne, who scored the fifth goal in the win on Saturday will miss out on a start against his former club.
