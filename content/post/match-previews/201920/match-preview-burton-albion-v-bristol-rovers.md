The Gas were once again defeated 2-0 on the road last week, this time to Burton Albion meaning that in each of their three away league matches, they have been beaten 2-0.

Rovers’ previous defeats in the league this season left fans questioning the tactical approach of manager Graham Coughlan after just one shot on target in two matches but in their most recent defeat, Rovers were in control for large parts of the match and were unlucky to walk away with not even a point.

Rovers boss Coughlan stated after the loss to Burton that his side were unlucky in both the defeat at the Pirelli Stadium and the cup loss to Brighton the game before.

“Being so close, so near it is kind of a nearly story for me,” [he told the Bristol Post](https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graham-coughlan-full-transcript-injury-3275604).

“But I told the players after the game don’t expect a pat on the back from me or any well dones, we have come out of both games - Brighton and Burton - empty handed.

“It was tough, it was a tough week for us given the two results, Brighton and Burton. We probably deserved more out of both games but we didn’t get more so we soldier on and dust ourselves down and we carry on and one thing about this group is they do know how to react and they do know how to respond.”

Rovers go into the game with Accrington nursing an injury to central midfielder Ed Upson, who limped off in the opening minutes of the leasing.com trophy defeat to Plymouth.

Accrington go into the game having had a tough start to their second season in League One since promotion.

Stanley are 20th  in the League after playing 5 matches (One less than Rovers due to Bury’s absence) and Assistant Jimmy Bell has spoken of how difficult it may be for them to turn a corner this weekend.

"We've got a fantastic record against them, but that counts for nothing,” [he told the club’s Twitter page] (https://twitter.com/ASFCofficial/status/1169536781328556032).

"We will tell the players that and we'll go with a system and a style to try and beat the way they play.

"With all that, it should be a really good game."

New signings Connor Simpson, Aji Alese and Jerome Opoku are all available after joining on loan from Preston, West Ham and Fulham respectively.
