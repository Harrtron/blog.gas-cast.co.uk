Off-the-pitch, GasCast surpassed the 50 episode mark this season, and we hope that you all enjoyed listening as much as we enjoyed making the podcast.

On-the-pitch, however, it was a turbulant season. The whole point of the podcast is to share differing views, so we thought it would be a good idea to summarise our different takes on the season.

> Even though we secured our League One survival, I will not remember this season fondly. At the beginning I had optimism that we would push on this year, potentially fortcing our way into an elusive play-off position, under the leadership of the legendary Darrell Clarke. Instead, things went sour and we had to let our charismatic leader go, which is a real shame and something I don't think I'm quite ready to fully move on from just yet! 

> The jury is still out for me on whether Graham is the man to take us forward, aiming for those play-off positions, and whether we will ever be in a position off-the-pitch to realistically make that happen. But I hope, with this dissapointing season behind us, we can start afresh and continue to progress next season. Some news on the new stadium would always take priority for me over on-the-pitch matters currently!

### Mets

> This season can rightly be described as a disappointment. From the outset we were expecting a mid table finish with the possibility of a spin at the playoffs if we overachieved. I was genuinely excited by the signings we made in the summer. Upson seemed a steal from relegated MK, while Rodman and Payne on paper looked like great signings. Getting THD in was a risk that ultimately paid off (not soon enough for DC to keep his job). Even Matthews looked a good prospect.

> The start of the season seemed to go well. We were ambling along until November time when it started to go horribly wrong. The squad has shown to be unbalanced and lacking in creativity. On top of that some players that we're previously reliable like O Clarke and Sercombe were badly underperforming. Things weren't helped with DC sticking to Payne/Nichols as our front two.

> Getting dumped out of the cup by non-league Barnet and then losing at home to Doncaster saw DC get the sack and Graham put in temporary charge to try and keep us up.

> He immediately shipped out Bennet and Payne and brought in Agogo and the excellent JCH. Without his goals we would have been dead and buried a long while ago.

> He came in saying that it wouldn't be pretty and it hasn't been. Rovers have played some horrible to watch football, however Graham has completed the job he was brought in to do and has been rewarded with a long term deal.

> We can only hope that he can address the problems with the squad over the summer so we're not back here in 12 months time. We haven't had word from Graham about the kind of football he wants to play either. As long as its better than whats been served up this season I'll be happy. He'll have the fans on his back if its more of the same though.
