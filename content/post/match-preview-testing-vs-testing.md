### Bristol Rovers travel to Burton Albion this weekend full of spirit given their fine display in midweek despite defeat.

The Gas were knocked out of the Carabao Cup 2-1 at the hands of Premier League Brighton on Tuesday night but it took a stoppage time Glenn Murray goal to separate the two sides.

One of the star performers in Rovers’ new 3-5-2 system is academy graduate Alfie Kilgour. The centre back, who spoke with GasCast’s Harley Thorne this week, also signed a new deal with the club he started out with as a boy.

The defender spoke of his delight of signing the new deal, speaking on the club’s Twitter page, he said:

> "I'm delighted to sign my contract and get a new deal, it's a proud moment for me and my family as well.

> "Obviously I came back from my Maidenhead loan and the manager had me on the bench a few times, then I came on against Gillingham and made my full league debut against Plymouth.

> "I came on a few more times and then the message was come back fit in pre-season, so I did my best to do that and now he's put me in, it's good."

He added: 

> "I started playing football when I was really young and played for Bristol Rovers when I was six, seven years old, so I grew up watching them on Tuesday nights.

> "To then be playing is amazing, it's a proud moment not only for myself but for my family and loved ones."

Rovers go into the game with Burton being boosted by the return of Mark Little, who was an unused substitute in the 3-1 win over Oxford last weekend but club captain Ollie Clarke is a doubt after coming off early in the defeat in midweek.

Burton Albion head into Saturday’s match having a similar league campaign as their visitors thus far.

Both Burton and Rovers have seven points from five league matches, having both won two, drawn one and lost two.

The Brewers go into the game having beat Morecambe in the Carabao Cup Second Round in midweek to set up a home tie against Premier League Bournemouth. 

The win in midweek accompanied by the match against the Gas and a Leasing.com trophy fixture vs Crewe means that Nigel Clough’s side are in for a busy week but manager Clough has stated the importance of the League match over the two cup ties.

> "It's a big week for us with the three games. Bristol Rovers is by far the most important one on Saturday, then the EFL Trophy game against Crewe is next Tuesday.

> "We go now and get ready for Saturday, because that's the one we really need to win”, [Clough told the Derby Telegraph] (https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/bristol-rovers-clash-most-important-3261409)

> "When you come off the pitch after the week we've had, with four points on the road in the League against Oxford United and Shrewsbury Town, and now we've had two clean sheets and we've scored eight goals, anybody who doesn't want to get out there and play again tomorrow and Thursday shouldn't be playing football.”

Burton could be without left back Colin Daniel after he limped off in the 4-0 win on Tuesday night. Other than this, Clough has a fresh squad to choose from.

This means that Rovers could come up against former player John-Joe O’Toole who is being deployed in a central defensive role for his new side.
